Creator:	This list was created to help easily define security control capabilities, domains/sub-domains, regulatory complaince alignment and security framework alignment.
	I worked on a similar project at a previous employer and found that having a list of capabilities clearly defined, security framework alingment, and regulatory compliance alignment was incredibly helpful in determining how to secure people, process, technology, and data.
	This work was creating using several generative AI solutions, with thorough review. This is in a cronic state of update.
